"""Regression test: a SIGTERM-killed host must still run driver cleanup.

atexit does not run on signal death, so without a signal handler a SIGTERM
(how orchestrators tear a process down) skips opends' driver_close and leaks
the pinned GPU dma-buf until reboot. This guards the handler in _file.py so a
future refactor cannot silently drop it again (it has regressed before).

Runs against the ref backend, so no GPU is needed: it asserts that
driver_close fires on SIGTERM, which is backend-independent.
